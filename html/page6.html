        <p>Seventeen...The pandemic started when I was that age. I
            turned eighteen that June. Graduated high school. Started college. All during lock down. All online. All
            within these four walls of my room. It was a lonely time but I got
            through it. Didn't I?</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>But it wasn't just lonely wasn't it? It was stagnate. Everyday I would wake up, go to my desk, and do nothing
            but scroll social media. Some days I wouldn't even make it out of bed. I thought that was over but isn't it
            what I just did today?</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Sometimes it feels like I'm still seventeen. Still watching that shelter in place announcement. Still waiting
            for the day I finally<span>grow up</span>.</p>
